## What Works....
- NVMe PCIe passthrough
- Single GPU passthrough
- Host CPU passthrough with minimum MacOS kernel patching
- PCIe USB card passthrough
- Major increase in graphic performance vs bare metal install
- Wifi/BT PCIe passthrough
- PCIe Ethernet NIC card passthrough

## What does not work (Works with patched kernel in [patches](patches) folder)
- On-board Realtek Audio passthrough (Works with the patched kernel)
- On-board USB Controllers passthrough (Works with the patched kernel)

**Disclaimer**  
Results may vary on your system. The results you see in this repo are based of above system specs. It may be different with different system specs.  
The patches in this repo are only needed if you are trying to passthrough the on-board USB Controller or on-board Realtek audio device.

## Instructions
1. Download [Proxmox VE 6.1 ISO](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads?task=callelement&format=raw&item_id=499&element=f85c494b-2b32-4109-b8c1-083cca2b7db6&method=download&args[0]=2ceb9af3734861c9c28a59daa85d86e3) and make a bootable USB drive.
1. Install Proxmox 6.1 on a separate small drive.
1. Boot the UEFI version of Proxmox VE from the drive you just installed it on. There will be the UEFI version and the normal proxmox version, make sure you set your first bootable drive in your BIOS settings to be the UEFI version of Proxmox.
1. Once you have booted and see the login screen, login as `root` and use the password you created during install.
1. Do the following commands in order to download this git repo and copy the pre-setup files needed:

```
apt-get update
apt-get install git vim -y
git clone https://github.com/Pavo-IM/Proxintosh
cp Proxintosh/etc/modprobe.d/*.conf /etc/modprobe.d/
cp Proxintosh/etc/modules /etc/modules
cp Proxintosh/etc/default/grub /etc/default/
cp Proxintosh/etc/pve/qemu-server/vm.conf /etc/pve/qemu-server/100.conf
cd Proxintosh/patches
dpkg -i *.deb
```

Now we need to start looking for information to edit [vfio.conf](etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf) to match your system and IOMMU groups.
```
lspci
```
You should see an output like below:

31:00.4 Audio device: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Starship/Matisse HD Audio Controller
...
```
This is just an example I have cut out some of the output to save the length of this README. Highlight and copy what devices you want to passthrough from the host OS to the guest OS and save that in a textfile for later use.

For example I am passing through my:
```
31:00.3 USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Matisse USB 3.0 Host Controller
2f:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Vega 20 [Radeon VII] (rev c1)
```
...and a few other devices, but this should give you a general idea of how to go about passing through all the devices you have selected.  

Next you need to get the device-id of those devices by using the `lspci -n -s xx:xx.x` command. The `xx:xx.x` is from the device address that gets assigned by the kernel. From the example above the USB Controller is `31:00.0`, so the command would be `lspci -n -s 31:00.0`. Example output of that command looks like...

```
31:00.3 0c03: 1022:149c
```
Make note of each device-id that you are wanting to passthrough to the guest OS. Once you have all the device-ids you want to passthrough to the guest OS, you use your favorite editor application, Vim is mine and edit the [vfio.conf](etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf) located in `/etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf`.

After you have edited the [vfio.conf](etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf) file, you need to do the following commands...

```
update-initramfs -u -k all
update-grub
pve-efiboot-tool refresh
reboot
```
After the system reboots and you are back into the system, you need to open your web browers and go to the IP address that you setup during the install process of Proxmox VE. Login and on the left handside expand the `pve` tree. 

Locate the 100 VM that is already created for you, by copying the [vm.conf](etc/pve/qemu-server/vm.conf) earlier.

Delete the `EFI Disk` and recreate a new one, this is needed because your fresh setup didn't have a local disk made for the EFI disk.

Now click on each `hostpci` device and change them to the devices your have selected earlier.

Now you should be able to boot the VM without issues.
